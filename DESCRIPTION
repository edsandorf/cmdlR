Description: The problem of choice is fundamental to economics. Choice models are used to understand how people make choices in markets. cmdlR is a set of wrapper functions around a user written log-likelihood function. The package also contain several functions to check for local-optima, calculate welfare measures, compare results and make predictions. To get started, the package contains several examples with pre-programmed log-likelihood functions that can be easily tweaked by the user.
