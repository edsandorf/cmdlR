#' cmdlR: Choice Modeling in R
#' 
#' The problem of choice is fundamental to economics and understanding how 
#' people make decisions is important. As researchers we try to find or 
#' generate data through experimetns that will enable us to understand bbetter
#' how people make decisions. Choice modeling is the art of applying 
#' choice models to data. 
#' 
#' This R package contains an easy to use framework that will help an
#' econometrician estimate choice models in R. It is the culmination of years 
#' of working with choice models and programming in R. It is the framework
#' that I use in my research when I estimate such models. 
#' 
#' I make no claims that this package is better than others and indeed 
#' packages such as Apollo includes much more built in functionality and much
#' more help to the user.
